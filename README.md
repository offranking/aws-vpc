AWS VPC - Private Cloud


This project demonstrates how to effectively utilize our VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) on AWS.
In this section, we focus on creating the VPC itself laying the foundation for secure, isolated networking within the AWS cloud. This step is essential for setting up resources like subnets, routing tables, and gateways, allowing us to manage traffic and network architecture with precision and flexibility.
